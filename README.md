# Bioinformatics Projects
Mini-projects solved and adapted from Bioinformatics MSc coursework

## 1. Species Tree Clustering
Infer the phylogenetic tree from DNA sequences. Clustering by UPGMA algorithm.

## 2. Simulate DNA Sequence Evolution
Simulates evolution on input DNA sequences. Nucleotide mutations are encoded in the Substitution model (matrix Q), which reflects the relative rate of transitions (A<-->G, C<-->T) to transversions (A<-->C, G<-->T).

## 3. Compare Immune Repertoires
Processes High Throughput Sequencing data from immune cell B/T cell receptor populations from individuals subjected to different treatments. Produces figures with diversity region (CDR3) statistics, and comparisons between two treatments.

## 4. Cancer SNV detection
SNV detection from tumor and normal tissues with Fisher's Exact Test and False Discovery Rate correction.

## 5. Lasso (L1), Ridge (L2) and Elastic-Net Regularization and Feature Selection
Test which regularizer selects optimal feature set from yeast gene expression data, and correctly classifies the children strains as coming from one or another parent (strain cross experiment).

## 6. Bayesian Nets
Analyse yeast cell-cycle regulator genes and learn optimal Bayesian Network
