# Bioinformatics Algorithms
Classical algorithms implemented in R

## 1. Species Tree Clustering
Infer the phylogenetic tree from DNA sequences. Clustering by UPGMA algorithm.

## 2. Simulate DNA Sequence Evolution
Simulates evolution on input DNA sequences. Nucleotide mutations are encoded in the Substitution model (matrix Q), which reflects the relative rate of transitions (A<-->G, C<-->T) to transversions (A<-->C, G<-->T).
